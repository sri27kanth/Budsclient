You can choose one of these solutions to fix this issue:

• Uninstall the Galaxy Buds plugin for the Samsung Wearable app althogether.
                    
• Use an app like 'Hail' or 'Ice Box' to temporarily freeze the official Galaxy Buds plugin for the Samsung Wearable app to prevent it from running.
